Expensive-Beacon
================
Expensive Beacons is an addon on to Citadel that allows better control over Beacons.
Through the use of multi block structures beacons can now places over diamond structures and give a certain group a potion effect.
The affect only applies to the group that the beacon is reinforced with.

How to build the beacons can be found by doing /eb_c <type> <tier> and by pointing at a beacon and it will build how the strcuture looks.

Current Beacons
====
Beacon kinds are as follows; speed, strength, haste, regen, and super.  Each tier of each beacon increases the range and after tier four the level of the effect.  This applies to all beacons except the mega beacon which has only one tier and has a huge range and level 2 of each potion effect.

Current Development
=========
The structure will have certain hardpoints and depending where you start breaking the blocks it will have different effects. So lets say a structure has 18000 hit points. This would be the equivalent of 1 dro for diamond blocks. So if you are breaking a diamond block on the structure it will be as if you are breaking a piece of dro. Second these hitpoints will be shared across the entire stucture, so if you and your friends were all breaking different diamond blocks it would all count against the same hit points. But then there are the beacons on the structures and attacking those will do 10 times more hitpoints than the standard diamond block making these the weak points of the structure.
But here is the best part, once you have successfully destroyed a beacon it will be in repair mode which means the entire structure will be invulnerable to block breaks for x amount of time. It will still output potion effects during this time and it will only stop after the timer has finished.
