Expensive-Beacon
================
Expensive Beacons is an addon on to Citadel that allows better control over Beacons.
Through the use of multi block structures beacons can now places over diamond structures and give a certain group a potion effect.
The affect only applies to the group that the beacon is reinforced with.

How to build the beacons can be found by doing /eb_c <type> <tier> and by pointing at a beacon and it will build how the strcuture looks.

Current Beacons
====
Beacon kinds are as follows; speed, strength, haste, regen, and super.  Each tier of each beacon increases the range and after tier four the level of the effect.  This applies to all beacons except the mega beacon which has only one tier and has a huge range and level 2 of each potion effect.

Commands
===========
So few commands you should get to know:

1. /eb_create <type> <tier>: this command creates fake blocks around a beacon which shows exactly how to build it.
2. /eb_refresh <type> <tier>: This refreshes the blocks around you.
3. /eb_info: While looking at a beacon this command gives general information about the status of the beacon.
4. eb_fix: While having the correct amount of materials in your inventory, this command fixes a beacon while it is broken.

How Beacons work
=========
The structure will have certain hardpoints and depending where you start breaking the blocks it will have different effects. So lets say a structure has 18000 hit points. This would be the equivalent of 1 dro for diamond blocks. So if you are breaking a diamond block on the structure it will be as if you are breaking a piece of dro. Second these hitpoints will be shared across the entire stucture, so if you and your friends were all breaking different diamond blocks it would all count against the same hit points.

Beacons have to be matured to be able to work.  This takes 24 hours.  While it is maturing it can be easily broken.  Once beacons are matured and broken again it goes into a 24 hour invulnerability mode where no blocks can be removed/ broken.  Potion effects continue to apply during this time.  After this 24 hour point the beacon structure no longer outputs potion effects and can be broken.

Also while a beacon is in invulnerability time an owner/mod can run up to the beacon and type /eb_fix which will fix the beacon if you have the required materials.  This will instantly fix the beacon to 5 percent of the maximum health.  Also beacons auto repair every 72000 ticks about 5 percent of their maximum health.
