Expensive-Beacon
================
Expensive Beacons is an addon on to Citadel that allows better control over Beacons.
Through the use of multi block structures beacons can now places over diamond structures and give a certain group a potion effect.
The affect only applies to the group that the beacon is reinforced with.
